# gen_rfl

gen_rfl is a C++ reflection code generation tool that automatically generates reflection functions for C++ classes when executed. Users can leverage these functions to access struct member variables, read their values, and modify them.

Unlike other reflection libraries on GitHub, gen_rfl adopts a source-code generation approach. It produces readable and inspectable C++ code for each struct, offering excellent transparency and debuggability.
